# Resume Download Setup Instructions

## What was implemented:

1. **Download Resume Button**: Added to both desktop and mobile navigation in the Header component
2. **Eye-catching Portfolio Description**: Updated the Personal Portfolio project description to match the character length of your MediEz description (322 characters) with more compelling content
3. **Download Functionality**: Automatically triggers PDF download when clicked

## To complete the setup:

### Step 1: Add Your Resume PDF
1. Place your resume PDF file in the `public` folder
2. Name it `resume.pdf` (or update the file path in Header.js if you use a different name)
3. The download button will automatically work once the PDF is in place

### Step 2: File Structure
```
portfolio/
├── public/
│   ├── resume.pdf  ← Place your resume here
│   ├── index.html
│   └── logo.jpeg
└── src/
    └── components/
        └── Header.js  ← Download functionality added here
```

### Step 3: Customization (Optional)
- You can change the download filename by modifying the `link.download` property in the `downloadResume` function in Header.js
- Current filename: "Abhisek_Resume.pdf"
