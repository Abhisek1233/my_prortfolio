2. Click "Add New Service"
3. Choose "Gmail" (recommended for personal use)
4. Follow the instructions to connect your Gmail account
5. Note down the **Service ID** (e.g., `service_abc123`)

## Step 3: Create an Email Template

1. Go to "Email Templates" in your dashboard
2. Click "Create New Template"
3. Use these template variables in your email content:

```
Subject: New Contact Form Message from {{from_name}}

Hello Abhisek,

You have received a new message from your portfolio contact form:

From: {{from_name}} ({{from_email}})
Subject: {{subject}}

Message:
{{message}}

---
This email was sent from your portfolio contact form.
```

4. Set the "To Email" to your Gmail address: `abhisekbehera506@gmail.com`
5. Set "Reply To" to `{{from_email}}`
6. Save the template and note down the **Template ID** (e.g., `template_xyz456`)

## Step 4: Get Your User ID (Public Key)

1. Go to "Account" â†’ "General" in your EmailJS dashboard
2. Find your **User ID** (Public Key) - it looks like `user_abc123xyz`

## Step 5: Update Your Configuration

1. Open `src/config/emailjs.js`
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual IDs:

```javascript
export const emailJSConfig = {
  serviceId: 'service_abc123', // Your actual service ID
  templateId: 'template_xyz456', // Your actual template ID
  userId: 'user_abc123xyz' // Your actual user ID
};
```

## Step 6: Test the Contact Form

1. Start your development server: `npm start`
2. Navigate to the contact section
3. Fill out the form and click "Send Message"
4. Check your Gmail inbox for the test message

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure all IDs are correct and properly copied
- Check your browser's console for any error messages
- Verify your Gmail account is properly connected to EmailJS
- Check your EmailJS dashboard for delivery status

## Security Note
